# Cognitive-Neuroscience-of-Schizophrenia-Lab


Over May - September 2025, I worked as a **Data Science and Machine Learning Undergraduate Research Assistant** at the **CNoS (Cognitive Neuroscience of Schizophrenia) Lab**, led by **Dr. Todd Woodward**, at the BC Childrem's Hospital Research Institute.

The code largely lies at the intersection of machine learning and computational neuroscience, and by using advanced linear algebra techniques (such as SVD and CPCA), aims to reduce how much time these computations take, by building in parallelization.
